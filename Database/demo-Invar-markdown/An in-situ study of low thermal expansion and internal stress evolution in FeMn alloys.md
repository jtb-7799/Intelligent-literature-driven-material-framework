# Abstract  

The mechanism of low thermal expansion phenomenon in antiferromagnetic FeMn alloys needs to be revealed. In this work, the evolution of lattice thermal expansion and internal stress in FeMn alloys was investigated by in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction during thermal cycling. Preceding the martensitic transformation, the coefficient of lattice thermal expansion (CLTE) decreased and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peaks broadened abnormally. The evolution of the lattice thermal expansion and the FWHM were both reversible and isotropic. The additional reflection spots around the fundamental diffraction spots in the electron diffraction patterns of austenite and the dispersed nano-scale martensite embryos in austenite observed in the dark field TEM images proves the existence of premartensitic transformation. Similar phenomena were found in FeMn Invar alloy, which indicate that the Invar effect is closely related to the internal stress evolution caused by premartensitic transformation.

# Introduction  

Invar alloys are a special group of metallic materials that have a very low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). Owing to their excellent dimensional stability, they have been widely exploited for the construction of precision instruments, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage tank, resonators, support systems for astronomical telescopes, microwave communications devices [1, 2]. Common Invar alloys including FeNi and FeNiCo ferromagnetic alloys are unsuitable for the strong magnetic environment, while the antiferromagnetic FeMn Invar alloys are more applicable due to their insensitivity to magnetic field [3-5]. In order to improve the development and application of FeMn Invar alloys, it is indispensable to have better understanding of the mechanism of low thermal expansion phenomenon (also known as Invar effect) in the antiferromagnetic FeMn alloys.  

At present, the mechanism of antiferromagnetic Invar effect still remains elusive. The mechanism of Invar effect is generally attributed to the transitions of iron atom from ferromagnetic state to other states [6-9]. Fujimori [10] suggested that the antiferromagnetic Fe-Mn alloys should not exhibit Invar effect, because it contains no ferromagnetic atoms, which is opposite to the experimental results. A new model for the Fe-Ni Invar alloys was proposed that the magnetic structure is a continuous transition from the ferromagnetic state at high volumes to a disordered non-collinear configuration at low volumes [11]. However, inelastic neutron scattering experiment showed that the $\mathrm{Fe}{-}34(\mathrm{at.}\%)\mathrm{Mn}$ Invar alloy exhibited a simple collinear magnetic structure [12]. Y. Endoh et al. [13, 14] indicated that the enhanced electron-phonon interaction cause the softening of the phonons and the lattice dynamical anomaly in both of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Invar alloys. But the lattice thermal expansion anomalies have not been completely understood.  

Some researchers suggested that Invar effect has a close relation to premartensitic transformation [15-17], and both phenomena possess similar anomalies, which can be embodied in the phenomena such as the diffuse scattering in diffraction, thermal and elasticity abnormity [18-22]. Premartensitic transformation is a precursor phenomenon of martensitic transformation, forming martensite embryos caused by local lattice deformation [23]. Rao et al. [16, 17] found that the nano-scale martensite embryos of pre-transformation generated a larger volume, compensating for the contraction of lattice and resulting in Invar effect. However, this mechanism has not been extended to antiferromagnetic Invar alloys.  

The premartensitic transformation generally occurs before martensitic transformation [15, 24]. According to the phase diagram of FeMn alloy [4, 25], the phase boundary between the $\gamma$ austenite and ε martensite phases is near the Mn content of $26~\mathrm{at.}\%$ , and the alloys in the Mn-rich side show Invar effect. Therefore, an Fe-24Mn (at. $\%$ ) alloy possessing martensitic transformation and an Fe-27Mn (at. $\%)$ ) showing Invar effect were selected for comparison.  

The volume expansion and the lattice distortion of the martensite embryos will cause an internal stress within the parent phase matrix. In this regard, in-situ synchrotron high energy X-ray diffraction (HE-XRD) technique can be used to detect the process of the premartensitic transformation [26, 27]. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peaks can reflect the evolution of internal stress [28-30]. In this study, the lattice thermal expansion behaviors and internal stress evolution in FeMn alloys were investigated by in-situ HE-XRD and several similar abnormal phenomena between thermal expansion and premartensitic transformation were discussed in detail.  

# Material and methods  

With the pure elemental constituents, iron $(99.9\mathrm{\wt.}\%)$ ) and manganese $(99.9\mathrm{\wt.}\%)$ ), two alloy ingots of Fe-24 at. $\%$ Mn and Fe-27 at. $\%$ Mn were prepared by vacuum induction melting. The cast ingots were sealed in a vacuum quartz tube and homogenized at $1050~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $^{5\mathrm{h}}$ , and then hot rolled at $980^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ into sheets of $2~\mathrm{mm}$ in thickness. The sheets were annealed at $900^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $30~\mathrm{{min}}$ in evacuated quartz tubes and quenched into water at room temperature. All the samples used in the present study were cut from the sheets.  

The thermal expansion behavior of the samples was studied by a horizontal thermal dilatometer (TA DIL802). The samples with a size of $2\ \mathrm{mm}\times2\ \mathrm{mm}\times10\ \mathrm{mm}$ were cooled from $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $-100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ with a rate of $10~{^\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ , held at $\mathrm{-100~^{\circ}C}$ for $5\mathrm{{min}}$ for temperature uniformity, and then heated up to $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ with the same rate. The macroscopic thermal expansivity was calculated by $\Delta\mathrm{l}/\mathrm{l}_{0}$ , where $\Delta1$ denotes the variation in sample length relative to $1_{0}$ (the original length of the samples at room temperature). The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) was calculated by $\mathrm{d}(\Delta\mathrm{l}/\mathrm{l}_{0})/\mathrm{d}\mathrm{T}$ , where dT is the change in temperature.  

In-situ synchrotron high energy X-ray diffraction measurements during cooling and heating were performed at the 11-ID-C beam line of the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory, USA. Figure 1 depicts the experimental set-up for the in-situ HE-XRD measurement. The $\Phi=90^{\circ}$ represents the axial direction of the cylinder sample and $\upvarphi=0^{\circ}$ represents the transverse direction of the cylinder sample. The $\mathrm{\Delta}\mathrm{X}$ -ray had a beam size of $0.5\ \mathrm{mm}\times0.5\ \mathrm{mm}$ and a wavelength of $0.01173\ \mathrm{nm}$ with the photon energy of $105.7\ \mathrm{keV}.$ The diffraction was performed in a transmission geometry. The samples were first cooled from $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $\boldsymbol-100^{\circ}\boldsymbol{\mathrm C}$ , and then heated to $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at a rate of $10~\mathrm{{^circC/min}}$ . For data analysis, one-dimensional (1D) HE-XRD spectrums were obtained by integrating the two-dimensional (2D) HE-XRD patterns from azimuth angle $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$ . In addition, 1D HE-XRD spectrums at every $15^{\circ}$ between azimuth angle $0^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ were also obtained by integrating the 2D patterns within $\pm5^{\circ}$ of each nominal angle. The d-spacing and FWHM of the crystal planes were obtained by fitting the diffraction peaks in the 1D spectrums with Gaussian distribution function. The lattice thermal expansion is obtained by the evolution of the d-spacing strain with temperature. The first derivative of the lattice thermal expansion curve is defined as the coefficient of lattice thermal expansion (CLTE). The FWHM of Bragg diffraction contains instrumental and sample broadening, and the sample broadening is caused by grain size and micro strains [28, 29]. In this experiment, the broadening due to the instrument and grain size does not change with temperature, thus all the changes of FWHM are attributed to the microstructure evolution.

# Results and discussion  

3.1 In-situ HE-XRD analysis of Fe-24Mn alloy  

The thermal expansion behavior and in-situ HE-XRD analysis on the Fe-24Mn alloy are shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2a shows the thermal expansion curve. The sample exhibited the normal thermal expansion behavior during cooling from $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $130^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Upon subsequent cooling, the thermal expansion curve deviated from linear stage with a reduced CTE of $(13{\pm}0.6)\times10^{-6}/{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$ . Below $75~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (point C), the linear expansivity decreased rapidly, which is caused by the martensitic transformation. The sample showed a reverse martensitic transformation behavior upon heating.  

Figure 2b shows the coefficient of thermal expansion curves. Upon cooling, the CTE decreased rapidly below $130^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (point B), and an abrupt increase is seen below $75~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (point C). Upon heating, the alloy exhibited a low CTE of about $(10{\pm}1.6)\times10^{-6}/{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ below $75~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The CTE increased rapidly between $75~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and $130~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (point E). The sharp increases of CTE at points $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathrm{~F~}$ were caused by the martensitic transformation and its reverse transformation. An abnormal low thermal expansion phenomenon was observed before the martensitic transformation (stage B-C), which was reversible during the heating process.  

In-situ HE-XRD profiles of the alloy during cooling from $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $-100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and then heating to $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ were shown in Fig. 2c. The sample remained fcc austenite during cooling from $400~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $75~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and exhibited a reversible fcc $(\gamma)\leftrightarrow$ hcp (ε) martensitic transformation. Labels A to $\mathrm{~F~}$ correspond to those letters marked in Fig. 2a, b. To determine the crystal structure between stage B-C, the evolutions of the XRD peak areas of the $(311)_{\gamma}$ plane and the $(10\overline{{1}}1)_{\mathrm{{s}}}$ plane were shown in Figure 2d. It. The peak area of $(311)_{\gamma}$ started to decrease and the $(10\overline{{1}}1)_{\mathrm{{g}}}$ peak area increased below $75~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , marking the martensitic transformation starting temperature $(\mathbf{M}_{\mathrm{s}})$ ). Thus, it is evident that the sample remained austenite at stage B-C. Moreover, it shows that the martensite continued to form during cooling to $\boldsymbol-100^{\circ}\boldsymbol{\mathrm C}$ and then the reverse martensitic transformation started at about $180^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $\mathrm{\langleA_{s}\rangle}$ upon heating.

In order to figure out the microscopic mechanism of the abnormal low thermal expansion before martensitic transformation, the in-situ HE-XRD analysis of the lattice thermal expansion of the Fe-24Mn sample was shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3a shows the evolutions of the d-spacing strain of $(111)_{\gamma}$ , $(200)_{\gamma}$ , $(220)_{\gamma}$ and $(311)_{\gamma}$ planes of the sample during thermal cycling (obtained by integration at $0^{\circ}$ ). It can be seen that the d-spacing strain curves of each plane deviated from linear stage below $130~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (point B), indicating that the low thermal expansion of lattice is independent of the crystal planes.  

Figure 3b shows the evolution of d-spacing strain of the $(311)_{\gamma}$ plane obtained by integration at different azimuth angles. The variation trends at different azimuth angles were almost the same, indicating that low thermal expansion of lattice is isotropic.  

Figure 3c shows the coefficient of lattice thermal expansion (CLTE) of $(111)_{\gamma}$ , $(200)_{\gamma}$ , $(220)_{\gamma}$ , and $(311)_{\gamma}$ planes as functions of temperature (obtained by integration at $0^{\circ}$ ). It shows that the CLTE of all planes decreased rapidly with the temperature ranging from $130~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $75~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and then decreased slightly. An abrupt increase occurs above point F during heating was due to the volume expansion of the fcc-hcp reverse martensitic transformation. Figure 3d shows that the variation trends of the CLTE of $(311)_{\gamma}$ plane at different azimuth angles as functions of temperature were almost the same.

Figure $\mathrm{4a}$ shows the evolutions of the FWHM of different planes (integration at $0^{\circ}$ ). It can be seen that the temperature dependences of the FWHM varied among different crystal planes. During cooling, the FWHM of $(200)_{\gamma},$ , $(220)_{\gamma}$ and $(311)_{\gamma}$ remained almost constant at temperature above $130~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (point B) and then increased abnormally before martensitic transformation. It can be inferred that there is an accumulation of internal stress in the austenite lattice before martensitic transition. As the precursor of martensitic transformation, it has been reported that premartensitic transformation will cause lattice instability and lattice distortion [23]. Thus, the increase of FWHM before martensitic transformation can be ascribed to the premartensitic transformation. The increase of FWHM at stage C-D is due to martensitic transformation. It has been reported that the internal stress distribution shows a maximum near the interface and decreases gradually towards the inside of the hexagonal plate for the martensitic transformation [32]. During heating, the FWHM of $(200)_{\gamma}$ , $(220)_{\gamma}$ and $(311)_{\gamma}$ decreased reversibly with a hysteresis loop, which was caused by the reversible martensitic transformation.  

It should be noted that the FWHM of the $(111)_{\gamma}$ plane remains almost unchanged during thermal cycling. It is well known that the Shoji-Nishiyama (S–N) orientation relation (OR) is often observed between the fcc and hcp phase in FeMn alloy. The habit planes of austenite and martensite are $(11\overline{{1}})_{\gamma}//$ $(0001)_{\mathrm{{g}}}$ , respectively. Thus the elastic strain energy of the $(111)_{\gamma}$ habit plane is the minimum compared with other atomic planes, and the change of the internal stress is negligible during transformation.  

Figure 4b shows the evolution of FWHM of $(311)_{\gamma}$ plane obtained by integration at different azimuth angles. It shows that the evolution trends of FWHM obtained at different azimuth angles were almost the same, which is consistent with the phenomenon that the low coefficient of lattice thermal expansion occurred in all directions of the sample.

# 3.4 TEM observation of Fe-24Mn alloy  

As shown in Fig. 2d, continuous martensitic transformation occurred in Fe-24Mn alloy during cooling to $\boldsymbol{\mathbf{\rho}}_{-100}\circ\boldsymbol{\mathbf{\rho}}_{C}$ . Since the retained austenite at room temperature still had the potential of transforming to martensite, it is possible for us to observe the microstructure of the retained austenite phase in premartensitic transformation state by TEM. Figure 5 presents a TEM analysis of Fe-24Mn at room temperature $(20~^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . Figure 5a is a bright-field image. The sample consists of martensite lath and austenite lamellae [33]. This is consistent with the HE-XRD measurement of the mixed martensite and austenite structure at $20~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Figure 5b is a SAED pattern in $[011]_{\gamma}$ zone axis. It demonstrates the Shoji-Nishiyama (S–N) orientation correspondence between $\gamma$ austenite and ε martensite. Figure 5c is a SAED pattern in $[001]_{\gamma}$ zone axis. Some faint additional reflection spots near the fundamental diffraction spots of the fcc austenite matrix can be recognized, as indicated by the red circle. Figure 5d shows a dark-field image captured by using the additional reflection spot marked by the red circle in Fig. 5c. It reveals massive dispersed nano-scale domains in the matrix. Qin et al. [34, 35] reported that these nano domains are of a body centered tetragonal (BCT) crystal structure with three variants according to the Bravais lattice. These nano domains embedded in the austenite are also termed “martensite embryos”, which have been observed in other alloy systems during premartensitic transformation, such as Fe-Pd and Fe-Pt [21, 36].

3.3 In-situ HE-XRD analysis of Fe-27Mn alloy  

Figure 6 presents the thermal expansion behavior of the Fe-27Mn alloy. It is seen that the thermal expansion property conformed to the Grüneisen relation of normal metals at temperatures above $170~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (point B) with a CTE of $(23{\pm}0.4)\$ ) $\times10^{-6}/{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . When the temperature was below $170~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , the sample showed Invar effect with a low CTE of $(8.8{\pm}0.8)\times10^{-6}/{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

![](images/bacd40f29d1060c06d5f3a346fc333f254b7d2fd1df043112fdcd5a4b900b8a4.jpg)  
Fig. 6 Thermal expansivity curve of Fe-27Mn Invar alloy. The dotted line shows the normal expansion curves according to Grüneisen relation.  

Figure 7 shows the in-situ HE-XRD analysis of Fe-27Mn alloy. Figure 7a shows the 1D XRD profiles during cooling and heating between $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{-100~^{\circ}C}$ . It is seen that the sample remained in austenite phase (γ) during the thermal cycle. Figure 7b shows the temperature dependence of the d-spacing strain of $(111)_{\gamma}$ , $(200)_{\gamma}$ , $(220)_{\gamma}$ and $(311)_{\gamma}$ planes (obtained by integration at $0^{\circ}$ ). The d-spacing strain curves of each plane deviates from the linear relation obviously below $170^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (point B), which is consistent with the trend of macro thermal expansivity curve. Fig. 7c presented the d-spacing strain curves of the $(311)_{\gamma}$ plane obtained at different azimuth angles. The variation trends of d-spacing strain at different azimuth angles were almost the same, indicating the Invar effect is isotropic, which is an important feature of Invar effect.  

Figure 7d displays the coefficient of lattice thermal expansion (CLTE) of $(111)_{\gamma}$ , $(200)_{\gamma},$ , $(220)_{\gamma}$ and $(311)_{\gamma}$ planes as functions of temperature (obtained by integration at $0^{\circ}$ ). It is seen that the CLTE of all planes decrease gradually in the initial stage of A-B, then decreased rapidly at stage B-C, and finally decreased slightly at stage C-D during cooling. This indicates that the microstructure of Fe-27Mn alloy experienced three stages during cooling. Figure 7e displays the CLTE of $(311)_{\gamma}$ plane obtained at $0^{\circ}$ , $15^{\circ}$ , $30^{\circ}$ , $45^{\circ}$ , $60^{\circ}$ , $75^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ as functions of temperature. Similar to the evolution of the $\mathrm{~d~}$ -spacing strain of $(311)_{\gamma}$ in Fig. 3c, the coefficient of lattice thermal expansion shows the same trend at various azimuth angles, which is consistent with the isotropy of the Invar effect.

It can be inferred from the above lattice thermal expansion analysis that there was an imperceptible and reversible evolution of the microstructure in the austenite, which is closely related to Invar effect. The analysis of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) can give more information on the nature of this microstructure. Figure 8a shows the temperature dependences of FWHM of $(111)_{\gamma}$ , $(200)_{\gamma}$ , $(220)_{\gamma}$ and $(311)_{\gamma}$ diffraction peaks of the Fe-27Mn alloy (obtained by integration at $0^{\circ}$ ). It demonstrates that the temperature dependence of the FWHM of each crystal planes presents significant difference. For the $(200)_{\gamma},(220)_{\gamma}$ and $(311)_{\gamma}$ planes, the evolution of FWHM is completely reversible and can be divided into three stages. At temperatures above $170~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (point B), the FWHM remained nearly constant. In the subsequent cooling process, the FWHM increased sharply with decreasing temperature to $110^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (point C) and then increased slightly. The temperatures labeled by the letters A, B, C and D in Fig. 8a correspond strictly to the temperature in Fig. 7d, e. Thus, the temperature range of FWHM broadening (B to D) overlaps exactly with that of Invar effect. The FWHM broadening implies that the austenite lattice distorted gradually and the internal stress accumulated during Invar effect. It should be noted that the FWHM of $(111)_{\gamma}$ plane remained almost constant during thermal cycling. This abnormal phenomenon has been observed in Fe-24Mn alloy, which can be ascribed to the small elastic strain energy of the $(111)_{\gamma}$ habit plane.  

As shown in Fig. 8b, the FWHM of the $(311)_{\gamma}$ plane obtained by integration at $0^{\circ},15^{\circ},30^{\circ},45^{\circ},60^{\circ}$ , $75^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ showed the same temperature dependence, which demonstrated the change of FWHM was isotropic.

3.2 TEM observation of Fe-27Mn alloy  

Figure 9 presents the TEM observation of the Fe-27Mn alloy. The bright-field image of the sample shows that the sample was composed of equiaxed grains with an average grain size of ${\sim}1~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ in Fig. 9a.  

Figure 9b is a SAED pattern in [001] zone axis of the grain in the center of Fig. 9a which is indexed to the fcc austenite. Some additional reflection spots appeared around the fundamental diffraction spots, as is marked by the red circle in Fig. 9b. Figure 9c shows the dark-field image obtained by using the encircled additional reflection spot, revealing massive dispersed nano-scale domains in the austenite matrix. The structure of these nanodomains were the same as that of martensite embryos observed in the Fe-24Mn alloy, which is induced by the tetragonally distorted local regions in the fcc austenite [31].

3.5 Correlation between the low thermal expansion and internal stress in FeMn alloy  

Through the above in-situ analysis, we can clearly understand the correlation between low thermal expansion and internal stress. The FWHM of XRD peaks is frequently used to measure the internal stress due to the presence of lattice defects [39, 40]. In this work, the gradual increase in FWHM demonstrates the gradual increase of lattice distortion induced by the martensite embryos. The nature of the martensite embryos of premartensitic transformation is a dispersion of tiny regions generally in nano-scale [37] with the reversible elastic strains [31], accompanied by shear deformation of the surrounding lattice [38].  

The evolutions of the FWHM of (311)γ plane, the coefficient of thermal expansion, and the schematics illustration of microstructure in FeMn alloys are shown in Fig. 10.

Regarding the Fe-24Mn alloy, as shown in Fig. 10a, the FWHM increased concomitantly with the decrease of the coefficient of thermal expansion during premartensitic transformation, indicating that the accumulation of internal stress caused by the formation and growth of martensite embryos brought volume expansion, which offsets some of the lattice shrinkage of the parent phase during cooling. It is well known that the In-Tl and Ni-Al alloys undergoing a similar premartensitic transformation also exhibit a decrease of the coefficient of thermal expansion [41, 42]. Therefore, the premartensitic transformation and the low thermal expansion phenomenon coexisted and occurred synchronously. The evolution of internal stress and thermal expansion is thermally reversible, as shown in the C-E stage in Fig. 10b. This is consistent with the feature of premartensitic transformation, which has been proved to be thermally reversible [43].  

With regard to the Fe-27Mn alloy, as shown in Fig. 10c, the FWHM started to increase at $170~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , indicating that the martensite embryos formed and grew larger upon further cooling, which caused the decrease of the coefficient of thermal expansion at the same temperature. The formation rate of martensite embryos during B-C stage was faster than that during C-D stage due to the increase of the transformation resistance caused by the limitation of the surrounding parent phase.  

What’s more, the premartensitic transformation and the low thermal expansion phenomenon of FeMn alloy are isotropic, which may be ascribed to the randomly distribution of martensite embryos observed in Fig. 5d and Fig. 9c. According to the above experiment results, many similarities have been found between the low thermal expansion property and the evolution of internal stress, which makes us have enough reasons to believe that the low thermal expansion behavior in FeMn alloys is closely related to the premartensitic transformation.  

# Conclusions  

In this paper, the lattice thermal expansion behavior and internal stress evolution in the process of the premartensitic transformation and the Invar effect of antiferromagnetic FeMn alloys are studied. Based on our experimental evidence, the following conclusions can be reached:  

1) Preceding the martensitic transformation of Fe-24Mn alloy and during the Invar effect of Fe-27Mn alloy, the coefficient of lattice thermal expansion decreased and the FWHM of diffraction peaks of austenite increased abnormally. The evolution of lattice thermal expansion and FWHM was reversible and isotropic.  

2) There are dispersed nano-scale martensite embryos in austenite in both Fe-27Mn and Fe-24Mn alloys. The existence of these martensite embryos is responsible for the broadening of the FWHM of diffraction peaks.  

3) The similar evolution of FWHM before martensitic transformation and during Invar effect and the existence of martensite embryos demonstrate that the mechanism of low thermal expansion in FeMn alloy may be closely related to the premartensitic transformation.
