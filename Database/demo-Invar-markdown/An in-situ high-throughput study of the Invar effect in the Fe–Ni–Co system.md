The Fe–Ni based classical Invar alloy and the Fe–Ni–Co based super Invar alloy are the basis for designing multicomponent alloys with low thermal expansion. In this work, we applied in-situ high-throughput experi­ mental methods to map chemical composition, crystal structure, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and magnetism in the Fe–Ni–Co system. The distribution of CTE $(80-200^{\circ}\mathsf{C})$ ) measured by the in-situ micro-beam Xray diffraction on the combinatorial materials chips (CMC) showed low CTE regions in agreement with previous reports. Combined with the MOKE measurements, the $\scriptstyle{\overline{{\mu}}}-{\overline{{e}}}$ relation of the Fe–Ni–Co ternary FCC phase is found to follow the reported FCC Fe–Ni alloys in the Slater-Pauling curve. A low CTE region is centred at ${\overline{{e}}}=26.7$ and $\begin{array}{r l}{\overline{{\mu}}}&{{}=1.26\mu_{B}}\end{array}$ in the Slater-Pauling curve. The observed low CTE zone not only matches with the classical Invar and super Invar alloys but also agrees with the reported Fe–Ni–Co based multicomponent alloys with a small amount of doping $(<5\mathrm{at\%})$ by Cu, Cr, Mn etc. The effect of $\mathrm{Cr}$ addition $(>5\mathrm{at\%})$ to Fe–Ni–Co alloys on the Invar effect is further discussed in terms of the interplay between magnetism and austinite stability.  

# 1. Introduction  

The Invar effect has been widely studied since the discovery of Invar 36 alloy by Guillaume [1]. Further developments such as super Invar and stainless Invar put forward the search for low thermal expansion alloys in multicomponent systems in recent years [2–7]. The Invar effect relates to magnetostriction and is sensitive to chemical composition and crystal structure, i.e., the magneto-volume effect of ferromagnetic ma­ terials. Although the physical nature of the Invar effect is not well un­ derstood, some multicomponent $\left(\mathfrak{n}~\geq~3\right)$ ) alloys show a decreased coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) than the classical Invar 36 alloy [8–10]. Masumoto [2] screened the Fe–Ni–Co system for the super Invar composition $\mathrm{Fe}_{63}\mathrm{Ni}_{32}\mathrm{Co}_{5}$ . Similarly, Rao et al. tried to design a multi­ component Invar alloy and explored the mechanism of the Invar effect via composition adjustment based on the composition of super Invar alloy [5,11,12]. It is also reported that the thermal expansion behaviour of $\mathrm{R_{2}}(\mathrm{Fe},\mathsf{C o})_{17}$ compounds can be tuned by the Fe: Co ratio [13]. Two high-entropy Invar alloys with low CTE ${\sim}2\times10^{-6}~/\mathrm{K}$ at $300\mathrm{~K~}$ have been discovered via active learning in a recent study [14]. The search in the multicomponent systems calls for the ability to map the properties in the full composition range instead of trying one composition by one composition.  

The well-known Slater-Pauling curve describes the dependence of magnetic moment as a function of the average number of electrons e (or valence-electron concentration VEC) per atom across the 3d-period system, which can be used to classify the magneto-volume effects in 3d metals. A recent work [11] has discussed the development of 3d transition-metal high-entropy Invar alloy by adjusting the valence-electron concentration. However, the published data in the Slater-Pauling curve are mostly based on binary systems. Fe, Ni and Co are the three ferromagnetic elements above room temperature (RT) in the periodic table and are the major elements in the Invar and super Invar alloys. Thus, Fe–Ni–Co is a suitable model ternary system for revisiting the classical results and forming the basis to further discuss the

multicomponent alloys with low CTE.  

The thin film-based combinatorial materials chip (CMC) method [15] has become a commonly practised technique for high-throughput material screening in recent years. Our previous works demonstrate the construction of the composition-phase map of the ternary alloy systems by high-throughput micro-beam X-ray diffraction of the CMCs [16,17] and have mapped the magnetic properties over the chip by magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) equipment [18,19]. The CMC method takes the advantage of mapping the properties over a wide composition range which enables finding new alloys in the unknown space. For the thermal expansion measurement, besides the time-domain probe beam deflection (TD-PBD) and high-resolution dig­ ital single lens reflex (DSLR) methods [20,21], the in-situ diffraction method is a potential high-throughput way as reported in many works [5,22,23]. If the micro-beam X-ray diffraction of CMC could be carried out in-situ upon heating, thermal expansion of the lattice as a function of composition would be studied in a high-throughput manner. This would deepen the understanding of the Invar effect in multicomponent systems from a relatively large amount of data. Furthermore, the rich amount of data generated by the CMC method would benefit the data-driven investigation using machine learning algorithms.  

In this work, we carried out a comprehensive study of the thermal expansion character in the Fe–Ni–Co system using the in-situ heating high-throughput micro-beam X-ray diffraction of the CMCs on a syn­ chrotron radiation beamline as the core technique. The intrinsic thermal expansion of the lattice was determined over the full ternary composi­ tion space in addition to the phase constitution and lattice constants. Magnetization over the composition space was mapped by MOKE equipment. Six bulk alloys were prepared to validate and calibrate the results from CMC and to determine the Curie temperature. The measured CTE together with the $\overline{{e}}$ and magnetic moment per atom $(\overline{{\mu}})$ were combined into the Slater-Pauling curve [11,24] to discuss the abnormal thermal expansion of the Invar alloys with the magnetic vol­ ume effect. A novel direction to high-entropy Invar alloy design is thus discussed based on the results in the present work and from the literature.  

# 2. Experimental  

# 2.1. Preparation of CMC  

Fe–Ni–Co ternary CMCs of $200\ \mathrm{nm}$ thick were prepared in a home­ made ion-beam deposition system (HT-IBD) [25]. 10-cycles (30 layers) of wedge-shaped films were deposited on a $25\:\mathrm{mm}\times25\:\mathrm{mm}\times2\:\mathrm{mm}$ quartz glass substrate in the stacking sequence of Fe, Co and Ni by the moving mask [19]. The deposition direction of the three elements was rotated by $120^{\circ}$ (Fig. 1(a)). The initial vacuum in the chamber was $1\times10^{-7}$ Torr and the deposition pressure was $2\times10^{-4}$ Torr. Details of the preparation process can be found in our previous works [16,26]. The chemical composition of each point on the CMC is determined by the thickness of each layer of element [25]. After deposition, the CMC was annealed at $700^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for 4 hours (followed by air cooling to RT) to promote crystallization and chemical homogeneity in the thickness direction.  

# 2.2. In-situ high-throughput X-ray characterizations  

Simultaneous micro-beam (beam $\mathsf{s i z e}=24\times35~\upmu\mathrm{m}^{2}$ by KirkpatrickBaez (KB) mirror) X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy at RT was utilized to characterize crystal structure and chemical composition on beamline BL09B at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The experimental setup was a reflection ge­ ometry (Fig. 1(b)) where the incident angle of X-ray ${\mathrm{12keV}}$ , $\lambda=$ 1.0339 Å) was fixed at $15^{\circ}$ and the diffraction pattern was collected by an area detector (Pilatus3 $\hphantom{0}s2\mathbf{M}$ , Dectris) covering a 2θ range of $17-52^{\circ}$ . An SDD detector (withdrawn at high temperature) was arranged in the perpendicular direction of the incident beam to collect the fluorescence X-ray signal. The chemical compositions from the XRF were analyzed by the fundamental parameter (FP) method using the pure elements as the reference. The CMC was heated in-situ from RT to $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , $140^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and $200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in the chamber under dynamic vacuum $\l^{\prime}<1\times10^{-6}$ Torr). The step size of mapping on the CMC was set to $1\mathrm{mm}$ with an acquisition time of $20\:s$ for each pattern. 210 patterns were recorded at each temperature.  

Phase classification was carried out by automatic peak searching and manual discrimination to avoid misjudgments after geometry correction and intensity integration from the 2D patterns. Due to the strongly preferred orientation in the CMC, the strongest peaks of the FCC and BCC phases $((111)_{\mathrm{FCC}}$ and $(110)_{\mathrm{BCC}},$ see Fig. S1) were used to calculate the lattice constants. Gaussian-Lorentz blend function was applied to fit the diffraction peaks. The uncertainty in determined lattice constant was estimated to be $0.0006\mathring{\mathrm{A}}$ calibrated by Si reference powder. Eq.(1) was employed to derive the intrinsic volumetric CTEs $\overline{{\alpha}}_{V}$ of each point on the CMC between 80 and $200^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$ .  

$$
\overline{{\alpha}}_{V}=\frac{1}{\varDelta T}\frac{\varDelta V}{V_{0}}=\frac{1}{\varDelta T}\frac{a^{3}-a_{0}^{3}}{a_{0}^{3}}
$$  

where $a_{0}$ is the lattice constant at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , $a$ is the lattice constant at $200^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$ $\angles{T}$ is the temperature interval. The error in the $\overline{{\alpha}}_{V}$ was ${\sim}4.2{\times}10^{-6}~/\mathrm{K}$ given the uncertainty in lattice constant determination.  

# 2.3. MOKE characterization  

Local magnetic properties in the CMC were characterized on a homemade MOKE equipment (spot size: $100\upmu\mathrm{m}$ , 210 points on a CMC) at RT under polar mode with a maximum magnetic field of $500~\mathrm{mT}$ . Hysteresis loop (Kerr ellipticity vs. magnetic field) at each point was recorded and the technical details can be found in [18]. The noise in the Kerr ellipticity signal was ${\sim}5.7\%$ . The composition spread of the CMC was calibrated by a laboratory $\scriptstyle|\mathsf{u-X R F}$ spectrometer (spot size: $20\upmu\mathrm{m}$ , M4 TORNADOPLUS, Bruker).

# 2.4. Preparation and characterization of bulk alloys  

Six bulk alloys (Table 1), whose compositions were selected from the Invar effect region in the Fe–Ni–Co CTE map, were prepared by arc melting to verify and calibrate the CTE characteristics of the thin film. The ingots ( $_{\textrm{\scriptsize100g}}$ each) were remelted 5 times and homogenized at $1200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for 10 hours under an Ar atmosphere. The ingots were further cold rolled by $75\%$ reduction in thickness and recrystallized at $800^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for 2 hours to refine the grain size. The actual compositions were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer (S1 TITAN600, Bruker) and the phase constitution was characterized by X-ray diffrac­ tion (XRD, Cu Kα, D8 Discover, Bruker) at RT (listed in Table 1).  

Specimens for dilatometer measurement were cut into $^{6\times2}$ $\times20~\mathrm{mm}^{3}$ in dimension and tested between 25— $.500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ under Ar atmo­ sphere (NETZSCH DIL402, heating rate: $5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\ /\mathrm{min}$ , load force: $0.1\mathrm{N})$ . The uncertainty in measured linear CTE $(\overline{{\alpha}}_{l})$ was estimated to be ${\sim}1.7~\%$ . Curie temperatures $T_{c}$ of the bulk alloys were determined by thermogravimetric measurement under a fixed external magnetic field from RT to $900^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ under Ar atmosphere (PerkinElmer TGA 8000, heating rate: $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ /min). The uncertainty of measured $T_{c}$ was ${\sim}4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

# 3. Results  

# 3.1. Composition-phase map  

Fig. 2(a) is the composition-phase map of the heat-treated Fe–Ni–Co CMC measured by simultaneous micro-beam XRD XRF on synchrotron radiation beamline at RT. The phase boundary agrees well with the calculated isothermal section of the Fe–Ni–Co system at $700^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ by Thermo-Calc (Fig. 2(b) and Fig. S2). The data point density along the Fe–Co and Fe–Ni binary edge is significantly higher than that in the Fe–Ni–Co ternary region in Fig. 2(a). This is because the unary and bi­ nary regions span over the substrate in the present form of CMC compared with the traditional triangle-shaped ones [16,17]. With the increasing point density along the binary edge, the uncertainty of the phase boundary is reduced [27].  

However, the phase constitutions of the six bulk alloys are somewhat different (Fig. 2(b), Fig. S3 and Table 1). Alloys $\#1$ , $\#5$ and $\#6$ are FCC

single phase which is consistent with the phase region of the isothermal sections at $700^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and $600^{\circ}\mathsf{C}.$ Alloy $\#2$ is composed of $\mathrm{FCC+BCC}$ , which is within the two-phase region of the isothermal section at $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ whereas disagrees with the isothermal sections at $700^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and $600^{\circ}\mathsf{C}.$ . According to the calculated isothermal sections (Fig. 2(b)), the $\mathrm{FCC+BCC}$ two-phase region expands when the temperature decreases from $700^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to ${500^{\circ}}\mathrm{C}.$ . Alloys $\#3$ and $\#4$ are BCC single phase which disagrees with the isothermal sections either at $700^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{i}}$ . $600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ or $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The BCC single-phase region is relatively narrow in the calculated equilibrium isothermal sections. However, the experimental observa­ tions indicate a much wider BCC single-phase region for the bulk alloys [28,29]. Electron backscatter electron diffraction (EBSD) characteriza­ tions found martensite-like microstructure in alloys $\#3$ and $\#4$ (Fig. S4) indicating possible martensite transformation during cooling. No such martensite transformation is found in the $200\mathrm{nm}$ thick thin film of CMC.  

# 3.2. Lattice constant and CTE distribution  

A linear relationship between the lattice constant and composition following Vegard’s law [30] can be found in the FCC phase for $\mathrm{Fe}<60$ at $\%$ , showing a planar distribution $\mathrm{R}^{2}{=}0.97$ , Fig. 3). When $\mathrm{Fe}>60\mathrm{at\%}$ the lattice constant of the FCC phase shows a maximum and then de­ creases as the Fe content increases. This is mainly due to the sponta­ neous volume magnetostriction effect, which is closely related to the Invar effect and magnetic properties [31].

Fig. 5. Dilatometry curves of the six Fe–Ni–Co bulk alloys.  

The average volumetric CTEs $(\overline{{\alpha}}_{V})$ between 80 and $200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ of the BCC and FCC phases (Fig. 4) shows that the BCC region bears a relatively low CTE compared with most of the FCC region. In the FCC region, a distinct low thermal expansion valley near the Invar $\mathrm{(Fe_{64}N i_{36})}$ and the super Invar compositions $\left(\mathrm{Fe_{63}N i_{32}C o_{5}}\right)$ is clearly shown. The minimum thermal expansion is about one-tenth of its maximum. The distribution of CTEs over the Fe–Ni–Co composition space is in agreement with Masumoto’s results [2] showing a low CTE region in the vicinity of $\mathrm{Fe}_{64}\mathrm{Ni}_{36}$ . The variation of CTEs along the Fe–Ni binary edge in this study also coincides with the trend measured in the Fe–Ni diffusion couple via the TD-PBD method [20].  

For the bulk alloys, the measured linear CTEs $(\overline{{\alpha}}_{l})$ between 80 and  

![](images/b6493623aa03f31f9a504cc689d98b82152507fc46ffd3d225f65eb2918e74a8.jpg)  
Fig. 6. Maximum magnetization (Kerr ellipticity) extracted from the local hysteresis loops on the Fe–Ni–Co CMC. The two dark lines indicate the phase boundaries at $700^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$ in Fig. 2(b). The dots corr espond to the points of MOKE m t. The gree ntours indicate the low CTE regions in Fig. 4 (corresponding to ${\sim}50{\times}10^{-6}$ /K and $25\times10^{-6}$ /K respectively).  

$200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ show a low thermal expansion in the Invar (alloy $\#1$ ) and super Invar (alloy $\#2$ ) compositions as expected (Table 2 and Fig. 5). Alloys $\#3$ , $\#4$ and $\#6$ show much larger CTEs $[11-12\times10^{-6}\mathrm{K}^{-1})$ and a linear expansion over the measured temperature range (Fig. 5). Alloy $\#5$ $(\mathrm{Fe}_{53.5}\mathrm{Ni}_{36.7}\mathrm{Co}_{9.8})$ shows a moderate linear CTE of $6.54\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ be­ tween 80 and $200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Table 2 compares the apparent linear CTEs of the bulk alloys (both by this study and from literature) with the intrinsic volumetric CTEs measured on the CMC. It is found that the volumetric CTEs $(\overline{{\alpha}}_{V})$ are much larger than the corresponding linear CTEs $(\overline{{\alpha}}_{l})$ overall. The similar values of $\overline{{\alpha}}_{l}$ and $\overline{{\alpha}}_{V}$ for alloy $\#3$ composition is probably due to the difference in phase constitution: BCC single-phase for the bulk alloy (Table 1 and Fig. S3) and FCC single-phase on the CMC. Although $\alpha_{V}\approx3\alpha_{l}$ for isometric system theoretically [22], the $\overline{{\alpha}}_{V}/\overline{{\alpha}}_{l}$ ratio listed in Table 2 (excluding alloy $^{3\#}.$ ) is much larger: ${\sim}5{-}8$ . This difference is related to the diffraction geometry used in the present study, where the out-of-plane thermal expansion of the film was measured on the CMC. We took the $\overline{{\alpha}}_{V}/\overline{{\alpha}}_{l}$ ratio to be 6 in the following part for comparison between the data from CMC and bulk alloy.  

# 3.3. Magnetic properties  

The maximum magnetization distribution mapped by MOKE over the CMC is shown in Fig. 6 and the hysteresis loops over the CMC are shown in Fig. S5. It is found that large maximum magnetization values are along the Fe–Co binary edge and at the Co-rich corner, and small maximum magnetization values are distributed in the vicinity of the $\mathrm{Fe}_{75}\mathrm{Ni}_{25}$ region and at the Ni-rich corner. The region with small magnetization values in the vicinity of the $\mathrm{Fe}_{75}\mathrm{Ni}_{25}$ expands into the ternary region. The location of this region is close to the region with low CTE in Fig. 4 whereas their range and shape differ from each other. In the FCC single-phase region, the maximum magnetization distribution on the CMC in this work (Fig. 6) is consistent with that of the Fe–Ni–Co bulk alloy measured under $150\mathrm{mT}$ magnetic field [34], which indicates two minima at the Ni corner and near the $\mathrm{Fe}_{70}\mathrm{Ni}_{30}$ composition  

respectively.  

According to the theory, the Invar effect is due to the volume magnetostriction below Curie temperature. If we impose the low CTE region in Fig. 4 on Fig. 6, the region with low CTE overlaps at the edge of the region with the small maximum magnetization values. The Curie temperatures $(T_{c})$ of the compositions within the low CTE are above $200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ according to the bulk alloys (Table 2), which are higher than the temperature range for CTE $(80-200^{\circ}\mathbf{C})$ . The paramagnetic hysteresis loops shown in Fig. S5 infer a $T_{c}$ below RT at the corresponding composition (eg. $\mathrm{Fe}_{75}\mathrm{Ni}_{25}$ with $T_{c}{=}~101.2\mathrm{K}$ [35]). It is interesting to note from the present work that the low CTE region corresponds to relatively small maximum magnetization values. This trend can be further analyzed by the Slater-Pauling curve.  

# 3.4. Slater-Pauling curve combined with CTE  

The distribution of CTE and magnetization over the ternary Fe–Ni–Co system are shown in Figs. 4 and 6, and the $T_{c}$ of the bulk alloys are listed in Table 2. To combine multiple information about chemistry, CTE and magnetization, we append a $\mathbf{z}$ -axis to the classical SlaterPauling plot to indicate the CTE (Fig. 7). The chemical composition was converted into e and the maximum magnetization measured by MOKE was converted into $\overline{{\mu}}$ after a calibration according to pure Ni. The CTE from the CMC was reduced to $1/6$ of the measured number to compare with the apparent linear CTE data of the bulk alloys. The spherical data points are also coloured according to the colour bar in Fig. 7(a). To find the relationship among CTE, e and $\overline{{\mu}}$ more intuitively, the Voigt surface was applied to fit the data points $(\mathrm{R}^{2}{=}0.80)$ . The fitted surface shows a deep valley at $\overline{e}\sim26.7{\pm}0.07$ and $\overline{{\mu}}~{\sim}1.26{\pm}0.15~\mu_{B}$ (Fig. 7(a)). Some reported data of the Fe–Ni–Co-based alloys [12] (the alloys #1, $\#3$ , $\#4$ and $\#5$ in Table S1) were plotted as coloured cubes in Fig. 7(a) for comparison, showing that they follow the fitted surface when doped by $5\mathrm{-}7~\%$ of $\mathrm{cr}$ , Mn or Cu elements.  

Fig. 7(b) is the projection of the data points in Fig. 7(a) on the twodimensional $\scriptstyle{\overline{{\mu}}}-{\overline{{e}}}$ plane, which serves as a direct indication of the rela­ tionship among the CTE, saturation magnetization and the SlaterPauling curve. The data points from the Fe–Ni–Co CMC are found to follow the $\textstyle{\overline{{\mu}}}-{\overline{{e}}}$ relationship of the Fe–Ni FCC phase constructed by Xiong et al. [35] with reasonable scattering. When the e is less than 26.9 $(\sim\mathrm{Fe}>40~\mathrm{at\%})$ ), the data points start to deviate from the Slater-Pauling curve and corelate with our thermal expansion characteristics of the Invar effect. According to the surface fitting in Fig. 7(a), the ternary compositions showing the low thermal expansion are in the region close to the electron number 26.7 (i.e., ${\tt V E C}=8.7\$ . The minimum of CTE is centred at $\overline{{e}}\sim26.7\pm0.07$ and $\overline{{\mu}}\sim1.26{\pm}0.15\mu_{B}$ (Fig. 7(a)). An Invar zone which is defined using $\mathrm{CTE}<3.5\times10^{-6}/\mathrm{K}$ as the threshold in the fitted 3D surface is indicated in Fig. 7(b)). Both the classical Invar $\left(\mathrm{Fe}_{64}\mathrm{Ni}_{36}\right)$ and super Invar $\left(\mathrm{Fe}_{63}\mathrm{Ni}_{32}\mathrm{Co}_{5}\right)$ ) compositions are found to fall into this region (star marks in Fig. 7(b)).

# 4. Discussion  

The ${\overline{{e}}}=26.7$ (or ${\mathsf{V E C}}=8.7{\cdot}$ ) criteria is commonly used in previous works to explore the Invar effect. The Invar zone in Fig. 7(b) shows that the Fe–Ni–Co ternary system aligns with this empirical rule within the e ${\sim}26.7{\scriptstyle\pm0.07}$ range. Based on this, we would like to discuss whether this rule can be expanded to higher-order multicomponent alloys. In a recent work, Rao et al. doped $5\mathrm{at\%}$ Cr, Mn and Cu to the super Invar compo­ sition $\mathrm{Fe}_{63}\mathrm{Ni}_{32}\mathrm{Co}_{5}$ respectively and showed that the addition of Cr and Mn significantly increased the expansion coefficient, while the addition of Cu slightly increased the $T_{c}$ with the CTE almost unchanged [12] (data listed in Table S1). If we convert the compositions e, it is found that taking the $\mathrm{Fe}_{63}\mathrm{Ni}_{32}\mathrm{Co}_{5}$ (marked by a star) as a starting point in Fig. 7(b), the Cr and Mn additions significantly reduce the e and the $\overline{{\mu}}$ , dropping the alloys outside the Invar zone $(+\mathbf{Cr}_{5}/\mathbf{Mn}_{5}$ in Fig. 7(b)). In contrast,

the addition of Cu only slightly reduces the $\overline{{\mu}}$ and the alloy is within the Invar zone $\mathrm{_{+Cu_{5}}}$ in Fig. 7(b)). Moreover, Lin et al. studied the thermal expansion behaviour of an equiatomic FeNiCo medium entropy alloy alloyed by $10\mathrm{at\%}$ antiferromagnetic elements $(\mathrm{Fe_{30}C o_{30}N i_{30}C r_{10-x}M n_{x})}$ [36] (data listed in Table S1). The CTEs of the doped alloys are higher than the threshold of the Invar zone $(<3.5\times10^{-6}/\mathrm{K})$ in Fig. 7(b). After converting the compositions into $\overline{{e}}$ , it is found that these doped alloys are narrowly outside of the Invar zone defined in this work $(+(\mathbf{Cr_{x}M n_{1-x}})_{10}$ in Fig. 7(b)). These indicate that the Invar zone criteria derived in this work can serve as a guide in the design of some Fe–Ni–Co-based multicomponent Invar alloys if the alloying amount is $<5\mathrm{at\%}$ .  

According to Masumoto’s early model and Rao’s "treasure map" [2, 4], the CTE of Invar alloy is strongly related to the $\omega_{s}/T_{c}$ ${\bf\tilde{\it{\omega}}}_{\it{\omega}}$ : sponta­ neous volume magnetostriction), where a higher $\omega_{s}/T_{c}$ ratio leads to a lower CTE. Masumoto further suggested that the $\omega_{s}$ is proportional to the saturation magnetization $M_{s}$ at RT [2]. The ratio of $M_{s}/T_{c}$ of the classical Invar composition $\mathrm{Fe}_{64}\mathrm{Ni}_{36}$ is $\sim0.42$ . From Fig. 7(b) and reference data [4], the $M_{s}/T_{c}$ of the super Invar alloy $\mathrm{Fe}_{63}\mathrm{Ni}_{32}\mathrm{Co}_{5}$ whose CTE is close to 0, increases to 0.56 due to largely increased $M_{s}$ and slightly increased $T_{c}$ compared with the classical $\mathrm{Fe}_{64}\mathrm{Ni}_{36}$ . However, although the addition of Cr significantly decreased the magnetic moment, the multicomponent Invar alloy $\mathrm{Fe_{55.0}N i_{22.0}C o_{16.6}C r_{6.4}}$ [14] showed quite low CTE.  

To understand the effect of Cr on the Fe–Ni–Co based Invar alloys, we summarize our CTE data from the Fe–Ni–Co CMC together with Masu­ moto’s early work [37] on the quaternary Fe–Ni–Co–Cr alloys in Fig. 8. As both $\gamma$ -Fe and Cr display antiferromagnetic feature in the Bethe-Slater curve with negative exchange interaction [38], they were grouped in the (Fe, Cr)–Ni–Co quasi-ternary composition space. The regions for low CTE in Fig. 8 were plotted using the threshold of $\mathrm{CTE}<4\times10^{-6}/$ K for the Fe–Ni–Co CMC and the (Fe, Ni, $\mathbf{Co})_{95}\mathbf{Cr}_{5}$ alloys, and $\mathrm{CTE}<6\times10^{-6}$ /K for the (Fe, Ni, $\mathbf{Co})_{90}\mathbf{Cr}_{10}$ alloys in different colours. Compositions of the classical Invar alloys $\mathrm{Fe}_{64}\mathrm{Ni}_{36}.$ , super Invar alloys $\mathrm{Fe}_{63}\mathrm{Ni}_{32}\mathrm{Co}_{5},$ stainless Invar alloy $\mathrm{Fe_{37}C o_{52}C r_{11}}$ and novel multicomponent Invar alloy $\mathrm{Fe}_{55}\mathrm{Ni}_{22}\mathrm{Co}_{16.6}\mathrm{Cr}_{6.4}$ and $\mathrm{Fe}_{42.6}\mathrm{Ni}_{9.1}\mathrm{Co}_{39.5}\mathrm{Cr}_{8.8}$ [2,14,37,39] were plotted in the figure too. It is shown that the region with low CTE determined by the Fe–Ni–Co CMC almost touches the FCC/FCC+BCC phase boundary (grey line) at $700^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$ . The fcc-structured multicomponent Invar alloy $\mathrm{Fe}_{55}\mathrm{Ni}_{22}\mathrm{Co}_{16.6}\mathrm{Cr}_{6.4}$ lies at the phase boundary with $\mathrm{CTE}<3\times10^{-6}/\mathrm{K}$ (100–350 K). Coincidently, the regions with low CTE distribute along the (a) direction starting from the Invar alloy $\mathrm{Fe}_{64}\mathrm{Ni}_{36}$ to the stainless Invar $\mathrm{Fe}_{37}\mathrm{Co}_{52}\mathrm{Cr}_{11}$ direction in Fig. 8. This indicates that, for the low CTE regions, the increase of $\mathrm{cr}$ is coupled with the increase of Co and the decrease of Ni in the alloy as a general trend. In recent works, the Invar effect is attributed to the magnetically driven $\upgamma1/\upgamma2$ state transition of austenite or the austenite-to-martensite-embryo transition [5,40]. The decrease of Ni content is known to raise the martensite transformation temperature $M_{s}^{\gamma\to\alpha^{\prime}}$ , and the addition of Cr reduces the $M_{s}^{\prime\to\alpha^{\prime}}$ [41,42]. Thus, the two effects can be balanced though $\mathrm{cr}$ reduces certain satu­ ration magnetization. In addition, it is worth noticing that, when the Cr content approaches $15\mathrm{at}\%$ , no region with $\mathrm{CTE}<\mathrm{\bar{1}}\times10^{-5}\mathrm{\/K}$ was observed in the Fe–Ni–Co–Cr quaternary system by Masumoto et al. [37]. This sets the upper limit of $\mathrm{cr}$ content in this group of alloys for low CTE.  

# 5. Conclusions  

To summarize, the thermal expansion characters of the alloys in the Fe–Ni–Co system over the complete composition space were systemati­ cally studied by the CMC method based on in-situ heating micro-beam high-throughput X-ray diffraction on a synchrotron radiation beam­ line. Magnetic properties on the CMC were characterized by a highthroughput magneto-optical Kerr system. The complicated relation­ ships among thermal expansion, chemical composition, crystal structure and magnetism in the Fe–Ni–Co system were summarized into the Slater-Pauling curve. It is found that:  

1. The distribution of CTE $(80-200^{\circ}\mathsf{C})$ of the FCC and BCC phases shows low thermal expansion (Invar effect) region in the FCC single-phase region around the Invar $\mathrm{Fe}_{64}\mathrm{Ni}_{36}$ and super Invar $\mathrm{Fe}_{63}\mathrm{Ni}_{32}\mathrm{Co}_{5}$ compositions in agreement with previous works. 2. Saturation magnetization distribution in the FCC single-phase region shows a region with small maximum magnetization values in the vicinity of the region with low CTE. There is an overlap between the two regions. 3. The $\textstyle{\overline{{\mu}}}-{\overline{{e}}}$ relation of the FCC phase follows the reported FCC Fe–Ni curve in the Slater-Pauling curve. An Invar zone with low CTE is found to be centred at ${\overline{{e}}}=26.7$ and $\begin{array}{r l}{\overline{{\mu}}}&{{}=1.26\mu_{B}}\end{array}$ and matches with the classical Invar alloy and super Invar alloy. The present work indicates that the $\overline{{\mu}}$ should also be considered as an important parameter to understand the Invar effect in the Fe–Ni–Co system.  

4. The Fe–Ni–Co based multicomponent alloys with a small number $\cdot<$ $5\mathrm{at\%}$ ) of doping by Cu, Cr, Mn etc are found to follow the Invar zone in this work. However, deviations are found in the alloys with $10\mathrm{at\%}$ $(\mathrm{Cr},\mathrm{Mn})$ addition, which may be attributed to the complex interplay between the reduction of $M_{s}$ in magnetism and the reduction of $M_{s}^{\gamma\to\alpha^{\prime}}$ in austinite stability.
