Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding  

In this study, the effect of the addition of the Ti-Al-V triple refiner to invar 36 on the mechanical and physical properties was studied in detail. In addition, the shielding of electromagnetic interference (EMI) performance was investigated in range of X-band $(8-12\ \mathrm{GHz})$ . The maximum hardness and tensile strength of the refinertreated sample were obtained 195 $\mathrm{HV}_{5}$ and $611\ \mathrm{MPa}$ , respectively, while the average grain size was reduced from $100\upmu\mathrm{m}$ to $40\upmu\mathrm{m}$ . Mechanical features such as hardness and tensile strength were improved with the Ti-Al-V triple refiner and hot forging processes due to grain boundary strengthening. The minimum coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) was $1.14\times10^{-6}/^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $20\mathrm{~-~}100\mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for the hot-forged plain invar alloy. The grain/twin boundaries and residual stresses formed after forging inhibit lattice vibrations, which are naturally responsible for thermal expansion of solids. The EMI shielding performance of invar 36 was analyzed in range of ${\sim}\mathbf{-}55$ to \~-65 dB for the $1\mathrm{mm}$ thick sheet through $8-12\mathrm{GHz}$ .  

# 1. Introduction  

Invar 36, which was discovered by Guillaume in 1897 [1], is often preferred in applications where the thermal expansion coefficient is desired very low, especially in the aerospace, defense, and electronic industries. For example, it is widely used in composite tooling moulds, accelerometers, hermetic packaging, and various optical components for glass-to-metal sealing. However, invar 36 is ductile due to its single austenite phase; therefore, its application area is limited. As is known for austenitic steels, austenite in structures becomes more stable as the stacking fault energy increases, depending on the increasing Ni ratio [2]. Since invar 36 can be classified among materials with medium stacking fault energy $(\sim122\mathrm{mJ/m}^{2})$ , it is not hardened by quenching treatment [3]. In particular, the high Ni and low carbon content $(<0.005~\mathrm{wt\%})$ , which stabilizes austenite, complicates the martensitic transformation of invar 36 [4]. In general, stress-induced martensitic transformation (SIMT) occurs in austenitic stainless steel. The SIMT process is not complete in invar 36 because the thermodynamic T-zero temperature is lower than that of other austenitic stainless steels. SIMT could be real­ ized under cryogenic deformation conditions for invar 36.  

For these reasons, many researchers have conducted various studies focusing on other hardening methods instead of quenching hardening.  

Methods such as solid solution strengthening [5], fine crystal strength­ ening [6–10], working hardening [11–14] and precipitation hardening [15–18] have been studied extensively in the literature. However, among these methods, the fine crystal strengthening is the most effective method because it is easy to apply and low in cost. It is known that when the grain size in the microstructure is reduced, the grain boundary in­ tensity increases dramatically [4,19,20]. These grain boundaries considerably contribute to the strength improvement of metallic mate­ rials by hindering dislocation motion. The same dislocations can facili­ tate the plastic deformation by easily moving within the crystal and interacting with each other [21]. During plastic deformation, while dislocations move readily in certain planes and orientations within the grain, these motions are hindered by randomly located atoms at the grain boundary and result in dislocation aggregation. As a result of this, the mechanical properties of materials such as hardness and tensile strength are improved by dislocation agglomeration and high-energy grain boundaries. This strengthening phenomenon is known as grain boundary strengthening and is based on the Hall-Petch mechanism, which is related to grain size [22]. Increasing grain boundaries is the most effective way of preventing dislocation movement without dis­ turbing the CTE. Even though various plastic deformation processes are applied to decrease grain size, as a result of these, excessive dislocation and residual stress accumulation are formed in the structure, which is an undesired state [11,12,23]. These excessive residual stresses have a detrimental effect on the dimensional stability of invar 36 in service [2]. For example, while the CTE of Invar 36 was $0.7\times10^{-6}/{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ when sub­ jected to severe plastic deformation (SPD), the CTE increased abruptly to $2.4\times10^{-6}/{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ after heat treatment at $350^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in the study by Bitkulov et al. [11]. This is due to residual stresses in the structure formed by SPD, which inhibit lattice vibrations responsible for thermal expansion.  

However, the addition of various alloying elements in trace amounts to invar 36 as grain refiners can effectively reduce the grain size without causing excessive residual stress and dislocation density. In general, grain refiners activate the heterogeneous nucleation mechanism by forming chemically high melting point intermetallic phases and/or MCtype carbides with elements which present in the molten metal [2,6,7, 15,24,25]. These numerous particles play an effective role as hetero­ geneous nucleation centres, refining the crystals without further growth through the solidification process. Various alloying elements such as $z\mathrm{r}$ Ce, La, Ti and Nb are known to be used as grain refiners in the invar 36 alloy [6–9]. Among them, Ti and Nb have a strong carbide forming properties [9]. MC-type compounds formed by reactions between Ti or Nb and sufficient amounts of C additionally contribute to heterogeneous nucleation. However, it should be noted that these types of compounds can accumulate at grain boundaries, and this phenomenon can result in a weakening of the material strength. For instance, in the Hong-Guang et al. study, Ce-La added as a double refiner caused catastrophic dam­ age by creating a brittle phase (Fe-Ni-Ce-La) along the grain boundaries in the invar alloy [6]. Therefore, since classical nucleation theories covering thermodynamics and kinetics laws are considered in alloy design, determining the correct choice of grain refiner is critically important. On the other hand, refining elements such as Ti, Al and Nb added to invar 36 support heterogeneous nucleation by forming new phases together with Ni, such as $\gamma^{\ast}$ (Ni3(Ti, Al) and γ’’(Ni3Nb), and this makes a considerable contribution to the mechanical properties [9]. Several studies have also confirmed that the use of double refining systems ( $\mathrm{\Delta}$ -Ti, Ti-Nb, Ti-Ce, Mg-Ti, etc.) is more effective than the use of a single refiner on invar 36 [6–10]. For example, Hong-Guang et al. [6], Yu et al. [7], He et al. [10] and Chen et al. [9] reported crucial im­ provements in the mechanical properties of invar 36 by using double refiners: Zr-Ti, Ti-Ce, Mg-Ti, and Ti-Nb, respectively. In the study of Ti-Nb addition by Chen et al., while the average grain size was reduced from $185~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ to $101~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ , the hardness of invar 36 was increased from $146.6\mathrm{HV}$ to $185.5\mathrm{HV}$ in the same case [9]. The grain refining effect on the microstructure of invar alloy and hence on its mechanical properties is clearly seen in this study.  

According to previous studies in this field, it is seen that the Ti has a more impactful role as a refiner in the invar alloy especially when it is used with different elements. However, it should be noted that the CTE of invar 36 must not be disturbed while its mechanical properties have been improved. The low CTE feature is just as important as the me­ chanical properties in invar 36. The addition of various alloying ele­ ments (especially in macroscale) to the invar alloy can disrupt the low CTE feature by deteriorating magnetic lattice effect resulting from the magnetic moment interaction between Fe and Ni atoms. According to Weis’s invar theory, it exhibits a very low CTE characteristic below the Curie temperature related to a fully austenitic crystal structure [26]. It is therefore critical that the alloying process maintain a trace amount so as not to damage the austenitic phase structure in terms of the CTE. Within the scope of our work, the effect of the Ti-Al-V triple refiner, applied for the first time to invar 36, on mechanical and physical properties was investigated in detail.  

In addition, the electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding per­ formance of invar 36 was investigated for the first time in the frequency range $8-12\operatorname{GHz}$ (the X–band for radar), which is highly important for defense and aviation technologies. Fe, Ni, Co and their alloys, which are soft magnetic materials, are good candidates for EMI shielding owing to their high magnetization and low coercivity features [27–30]. Among them, invar 36 is an inevitable material in the defense and aviation in­ dustries, where dimensional stability is essential, such as in acceler­ ometers, and hermetic packaging, owing to its low CTE feature. In addition to the low CTE feature of invar 36, this is expected to protect electronic components inside devices such as accelerometers, from external electromagnetic waves, which may adversely affect its mea­ surement accuracy/precision. On the other hand, EMI pollution has become an important issue not only in defense/aviation industries but also in most electronic devices (television and mobile phones etc.) because it causes device performance deterioration and human health problems.

# 2.1. Materials and sample preparation  

The samples were prepared using a $5\mathrm{kg}$ capacity VAC-LONG VISM-5 vacuum induction melting system under $10^{-4}$ mbar vacuum and 100 mbar partial argon gas pressure. High purity $(99.99\%)$ Ni, AISI 1008 steel and a master alloy containing 90Ti6Al4V were used to form the alloy. The melting and casting processes were repeated twice to obtain a homogeneous invar alloy. In order to avoid casting cavity defects and consequent forging cracks, castings were made in graphite moulds heated to $800^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$ Three samples were prepared for this research and the coded as AC – ACHF – ACTIHF, as-cast condition, hot-forged after casting and hot forged after casting with Ti-Al-V additives, respectively. The chemical compositions were determined using a Bruker S2 PUMA Xray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer and the results are listed in Table 1. The ACHF and ACTIHF ingot samples were reduced in diameter from ${\sim}70\mathrm{mm}$ to ${\sim}35\mathrm{mm}$ by hot forging at $1200^{\circ}\mathsf{C}.$ A forging ratio of 2:1 was chosen due to the hot ductility drop phenomenon of invar 36 [31,32]. This phenomenon is called high temperature brittle intergranular frac­ ture, and is frequently encountered in austenitic alloys such as invar 36 [31].  

# 2.2. Characterization  

The samples required for microstructural and grain size analysis were cut from the cross-sections of the ingots. The samples were etched with a Marble solution $\mathrm{50~ml}$ HCl, 10 gr $\mathrm{CuSO_{4}}$ and $50~\mathrm{ml}$ water) for 25 seconds after grinding and polishing [33,34]. The average grain size was measured via the linear intercept technique according to the ASTM E122–13 standard from optical microscope (ZEISS Axioskop 2 MAT) images. An ImageJ programme was also used to calculate the volume fraction of twin boundaries. Firstly, the grain and twin boundaries, which were somewhat ambiguous in the optical microscope images, were clarified and transferred to ImageJ, where the total lengths of the boundaries were determined. The ratio of twin boundary length to total grain boundary length per scan field is defined as the volume fraction of twins [35,36]. The crystal structural properties of the as-prepared ingots were tested on a Rigaku MiniFlex $600{\mathrm{X}}$ -ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu-Kα radiation at a scan rate of $2.5^{\circ}/\mathrm{min}$ . In addition, the relative in­ tensities of the XRD peaks were calculated based on the maximum peak intensity [37]. Microhardness measurements, were performed using an Emco Test DuraScan micro-tester through the microstructure samples from at least 5 points according to the Vickers $\mathrm{HV}_{5}$ method at a load of 5 kgf (49.1 N). The room temperature tensile tests were carried out using a Zwick/Roell Z100 universal testing machine based on the ASTM standard. The thermal expansion properties of samples machined with $5\ \mathrm{mm}$ diameter and $20\ \mathrm{mm}$ length were tested using a Linseis L75 Platinum Series Dilatometer in the temperature range $20-150^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at a heating rate of $3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ in accordance with ASTM E228–17. The CTE of the samples was calculated according to the following CTE calculation principle (Eq. 1) based on the push-rod horizontal dilatometer method.

The electromagnetic properties of the invar 36 were determined in the X-band microwave frequency range $(8-12\mathrm{GHz})$ using a rectangular transmission waveguide technique. The samples were then machined to fit the internal dimensions of the rectangular waveguide (10.16 – $22.86\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{\times}$ ) and to be $1\mathrm{mm}$ thick. The electromagnetic measurements of the samples were performed using an Anritsu 37397 C vector network analyzer (VNA) at room temperature. Before testing, a two-port VNA calibration was carried out, after which the magnitudes of the complex scattering parameters S11 (forward reflection coefficient) and S21 (forward transmission coefficient) were measured. Finally, the electro­ magnetic interference, absorption, and reflection shielding effectiveness were calculated using the scattering parameters.  

# 3. Results and discussions  

The XRD patterns of AC, ACHF and ACTIHF samples are shown in Fig. 1. All the samples had fully classic austenite $\mathit{\check{y}}$ -Fe) XRD peaks and the strongest diffraction peaks were mainly from $\upgamma(111)$ , $\boldsymbol{\upgamma}(200)$ , $\boldsymbol{\gamma}(220)$  

$\gamma(311)$ and $\upgamma(222)$ . There are no peaks detected other than the austenite peaks in the XRD pattern because the alloying element is added in trace amounts. However, various changes in the positions of the 2θ peak an­ gles, their relative intensities and widths were observed after the pro­ cesses such as hot forging and especially Ti-Al-V addition. The residual stresses that accumulated in the structure after hot deformation caused a slight shift to the right of the XRD peaks when comparing samples AC and ACHF, as shown in Fig. 1(b). On the other hand, with the addition of Ti-Al-V to invar 36, the phenomenon of shifting of the 2θ peak angles became more noticeable. This shift seen in the XRD peak of the ACTIHF sample can be attributed to the more residual stresses that are generated in the structure after hot forging. Different sized elements contained in the alloy, such as Ti, Al and V, further distort the crystal lattice by creating additional microstrains throughout the forging process. It is well known that the FCC crystal lattice has a closed package structure and, accordingly, the lattice distortion results from the different atoms in the FCC lattice being placed as solid solution atoms [38]. According to the Bragg equation $(\lambda=2\mathrm{{d}}s\mathrm{{in}\theta)}$ , the shift of the diffraction peaks to high angles indicates a decrease in the crystal plane spacing and lattice parameter [39,40]. A similar phenomenon occurs in metals that have undergone severe plastic deformation, known as the residual stress and microstrain effect [41,42]. However, it is well known that atomic sizes of Ti, V and Al (0.147 nm, $0.179\mathrm{nm}$ , and $0.143\mathrm{nm}$ respectively) are larger than atomic sizes of Fe and Ni ( $0.126\mathrm{nm}$ and $0.124~\mathrm{{nm}}$ respec­ tively). In fact, while the 2-theta angle is expected to shift to the left, a shift to the right is observed. As the alloying is only present in trace amounts, it is understood that the effect of residual stresses and micro­ strain are more dominant. There is a significant reduction in grain size with the addition of the refiner, which can mean more grain boundaries in the structure and consequently more microstrains. This can be attributed to more residual stress in the structure due to the addition of alloying elements and the effect of deformation and increase in micro­ strain at the lattice structure [43]. The microstrain values of the samples presented in Fig. 1(c) were calculated using the Williamson-Hall approach, as described by Eq. 2 below [44]. It can be observed that microstrain values increase as a result of both hot forging and the refiner.

As the peaks obtained from the XRD analysis are characteristic of the austenite phase and there is no other peak, the XRD pattern have been normalized. Normalized XRD pattern is used in particular to compare relative peak intensities. The relative intensity variations of the samples listed in Table 2 were calculated based on the intensity of the maximum peak (111). It can be seen that the relative intensities of thermody­ namically stable planes such as (111) were higher in the all samples, in natural. Generally, the FCC metals are crystallized during solidification in the preferred directions, which is the further intensity of the atoms, to minimize the surface energy [45]. As known, the surface energy of (111) crystal plane is lower than others in the FCC metals [46,47]. Therefore, the (111) crystal plane, which has the lower surface energy, is ther­ modynamically more dominant in all cases. However, it can be seen that the various crystal planes are oriented with a recrystallization and twin effect resulting from hot deformation, and also with an alloying ele­ ments effect [48]. When AC and ACHF samples were compared, the intensity of peak (200) increased significantly while the intensity of the other peaks decreased after hot forging. This can be attributed to the recovery and recrystallisation of the metal microstructure under the influence of temperature and force during hot forming as a result of increased diffusion kinetics [49,50]. A similar phenomenon was observed in the study by Sato et al. [51]. It is important to note that no complete recovery and recrystallisation occurred following hot forging. This is because, although the forging process is carried out at a high temperature, additional heat treatment is necessary for complete recrystallisation in accordance with ASTM standards [52]. Conse­ quently, the observed changes in XRD peak intensities are also related to the preferential rotation of the grains during the forging process. On the other hand, it is interesting to note that the density of (220) showed a significant increase with the addition of the Ti-Al-V refiner. In the comparison of the ACHF and ACTIHF samples, no significant change in intensity was observed in the (200) and (222) planes, while a significant orientation was observed in the (220) and (311) planes.  

Fig. 2 shows the optical microscope (OM) images of the AC, ACHF and ACTIHF samples. Rather coarse grains were formed after casting in the AC sample with a size of ${\sim}500~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ , as can be seen in Fig. 2(a). It is well known that the solidification of molten metal in a mould first starts at the wall with a nucleation phenomenon. The growth of the formed nuclei continues from the mould wall in the direction opposite to the removal of heat [4,24]. Thus, the final grain size generated as a result of the ingot casting process depends on the heat dissipation rate of the molten metal. The solidification rate of traditional ingot casting in a refractory-based mould (sand, etc.) is close to thermodynamically stable cooling rates, resulting in the formation of relatively coarse grains [53]. These ingots, which have coarse grains after casting, are not used in directly in an application due to various possible casting defects (gas or shrinkage cavities, etc.) and poor mechanical properties. That’s why the ingots are subjected to various hot forming processes, such as forging or rolling, to obtain an intermediate product in a form of sheet or rod, and also to eliminate any casting defects. Particularly during the hot forging process, as shown in Fig. 2(b), the coarse grain size after casting was refined by the effect of recrystallization and dynamic force. Therefore, the grain size after forging in the ACHF sample decreased from $500~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ to $100\upmu\mathrm{m}$ . In addition to these, the deformation twins commonly encountered in FCC structures were formed during the forging process, as shown in Fig. 2(b and c). In this way, both grain refinement through the triple microalloying process and twin formation through hot forging contribute significantly to the improvement in the mechanical proper­ ties. Fig. 2(d and e) shows the images used in the Image J programme to calculate the volume fraction of twin boundaries. According to Wang et al., the ratio of twin boundaries to grain boundaries determines the volume fraction of twin boundaries within the structure [35,36]. As a result of calculations made using the ImageJ programme, the density of twin boundaries, which was $32.1\%$ in the ACHF sample, increased to $40.2\%$ in the ACTIHF sample due to the refiner effect.

In general, the refiners provide an extra nucleation center in addition to the mould walls, which allows solidification to begin, and as can be seen in Fig. 3, the grain size were become finer. It was seen in Fig. 2(c) that the average grain size was reduced up to $40\upmu\mathrm{m}$ . As can be seen from the EDS mapping analysis in Fig. 3, high melting particles such as TiC $(\sim3160^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and $\mathrm{{Al}}_{2}\mathrm{{O}}_{3}$ ( ${\bf\sim}2050^{\circ}{\bf C})$ made a significant contribution to the average grain size reduction by forming extra nucleation centres during solidification. It is well known that the carbon atoms have a greater affinity for the titanium atoms and the TiC is the most stable phase, while the aluminum atoms have a strong affinity for the oxygen atoms, resulting in the formation of a highly stable $\mathrm{{Al}}_{2}\mathrm{{O}}_{3}$ phase [54–56]. In addition to these, the Ti-Al-V addition had a significant impact on the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) mechanism during hot forging. In a study in which Ti-Mg was added to invar 36, He et al. reported that the DRX mechanism is the more dominant driving force, especially at tem­ peratures above $800^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ [10].  

The CTE results of the samples are shown in Fig. 4. Firstly, when the refiner-free AC and ACHF samples are considered, the CTE decreased from $1.86\times10^{-6}/{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $1.15\times10^{-6}/{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in the temperature range of $20\textrm{--}$ $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ with the hot forging process. This situation can be clarified with two different approaches. The first of these, the grain boundary intensity in the structure increases considerably as a result of grain size reduction after forging, and deformation twins and their boundaries have also been revealed. The grain and twin boundaries inhibit lattice vibration, which is thermally responsible for the expansion of solids [57]. It is well known that lattice vibrations in solids increase with temperature, and this way increased atomic mobility makes thermal expansion easier [2, 23]. Thus, in general, factors such as grain or twin boundaries that can restrict lattice vibrations can provide a lower CTE. According to the invar theory, the low CTE characteristic of invar 36 is primarily a function of magneto-volume contraction, but lattice vibrations are naturally still present and contribute to its thermal expansion [2,4]. In addition, the residual stresses formed after hot forging also play a restrictive role in lattice vibration or atomic mobility. Therefore, more grain boundaries, higher dislocation densities and residual stresses, which are formed by hot forging, contributed to the reduction in the CTE by limiting lattice vibrations [2,4]. This could be the reason for the decrease in the CTE with the hot forging process. Magnetic volume contraction and thermally induced lattice expansion can be affected by residual stresses associated with forging. It can also vary the interatomic distance and disturb the balance in the magnetic lattice structure, sub­ sequently contributing to exchange interspin interactions [58–60]. It is understood that there is a difference between the as-cast interatomic distance and the hot-forged interatomic distance. It is understood that the interatomic distances of the as-cast and hot-forged samples are different. Given that any micro-porosity formed throughout the casting was closed after forging, the balance in the magnetic lattice structure and, accordingly, the exchange interspin interactions could vary [60]. This case is supported by a slight shift to larger angles of the XRD diffraction peak, also shown in Fig. 1(b). These small variations in the crystal plane spacing and lattice parameters affect the lattice vibration and the mobility of atoms and are more pronounced in the CTE, espe­ cially at low temperatures, as shown in Fig. 4. On the other hand, the differences in the CTEs of the ACHF and ACTIHF samples can be attributed to isotropic CTE behavior. As can be seen from the XRD results of the ACTIHF sample, the intensities of the (220) and (311) planes have been orientated with a significant increase. Correspondingly, the in­ tensities of the other planes are reduced. The differences in the crystal plane directions cause changes in the elastic modulus and accordingly thermal expansion. It is well known that thermally expansion depends on thermal stress and elastic stretching of the crystal lattice [61]. In addition, the thermal expansion is generally low in directions where the elastic modulus is high. Considering that the elastic modulus of the (111) plane is higher in the FCC austenite crystalline, it can be said that there are preferential crystallographic orientations associated with the addition of Ti-Al-V at this plane intensity, and consequently, the CTE increases [37]. Although the CTE of the Ti-Al-V alloy sample is higher than that of the other sample, it has a more stable CTE characteristic as shown in Fig. 4. In general, preferential orientations tend to occur in specific crystal-dependent planes, where sliding is easier [62]. As a result of this, an isotropic CTE behavior may have emerged. In addition, part of the Ti, Al and V atoms could have formed a solid solution in the austenitic FCC phase as a substituent atom. Therefore, the FCC lattice order can be distorted in the form of substitutional or interstitial Ti, Al and V atoms. In fact, the main issue associated with the increase in the CTE with the introduction of alloying elements is related to the distor­ tion of the specific magnetic lattice structure in Fe36Ni. In addition, the formation of heterogeneous nucleation centres (intermetallic com­ pounds or oxides) in the austenite matrix can also cause distortion of the FCC lattice. All of these phenomena can slightly vary the interatomic distance, disturbing the balance in the magnetic lattice structure and contributing to the exchange of interspin interactions (Fe-Fe, Fe-Ni and Ni-Ni) [58,59]. The magneto-lattice effect, which arises from the mag­ netic moment interactions between Fe and Ni atoms in the lattice, could be partially destroyed by the dissolution of alloying elements in the invar matrix. Even though no other phase other than austenite phase was detected in the XRD analysis, as can be seen in Fig. 1(b), there was a significant shift to larger angles at certain peak diffraction points with the addition of the Ti-Al-V triple refiner.

Fig. 4. CTE results of the samples.  

The tensile test results of the samples are shown in Fig. 5 and the values for ultimate tensile strength (UTS), hardness and average grain size are shown in Fig. 6. Accordingly, higher UTS and hardness values of $610.9\mathrm{MPa}$ and ${194.3\mathrm{~HV}_{5}};$ , respectively, were obtained for the Ti-Al-V added sample (ACTIHF). As shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, the mechani­ cal properties of the AC sample, both in terms of UTS, hardness and especially total elongation, were minimal. In the case of the ACHF sample, the total elongation and UTS considerably increased after the hot forging process. This difference between the two samples (AC and ACHF) can be attributed to the fact that hot forging eliminates possible casting defects in the ingots and reduces the grain size. It is well known that defects such as micro-shrinkage or gas cavities can often occur after the casting process [63]. Such casting cavity defects can act as stress accumulation centres during tensile testing [63]. Thus, as shown in Fig. 5, a sudden failure with a minimal amount of elongation could occur unexpectedly. In addition, the dynamic recrystallisation mechanism played an active role in grain size reduction during the hot forging process. Invar 36 has a medium stacking fault energy (ɣSFE $\O=$

$122\mathrm{mJ}/\mathrm{m}^{2})$ accordingly, the dislocation density can easily increase to a high level by hot forging, resulting in localized dislocation density variations [3,4,64]. These localized dislocation density variations are considered as the driving force for the nucleation of new grains, and their quantities are also high enough to facilitate long-range migration of high-angle boundaries [64]. For this reason, discontinuous dynamic recrystallization can be assumed to be responsible for the reduction in the grain size of invar 36 during deformation and the resulting increase in strength.  

On the other hand, Fig. 6 shows that with the addition of the Ti-Al-V triple refiner, the grain size continues to decrease and the tensile strength, hardness and total elongation increase accordingly. A com­ parison of the ACHF and ACTIHF specimens revealed that the UTS, hardness and total elongation increased from $591.7\mathrm{MPa}$ to $610.9\mathrm{MPa}$ , from $191.1\mathrm{HV}_{5}$ to $194.3\mathrm{\:HV}_{5}$ and from $37.1\%$ to $40.2\%$ , respectively, while the average grain size decreased from $100\upmu\mathrm{m}$ to $40\upmu\mathrm{m}$ . A reduction in grain size due to the addition of a refiner also indicated that the grain boundaries, which are mainly responsible for the increase in mechanical properties, occupied a considerable amount of space in the structure. As the grain boundaries are the regions that limit dislocation movement, it is expected that the strength and hardness will improve as their proportion in the structure increases. This is because the different orientations of the grains make it difficult for dislocations to pass from one grain to another [64]. Dislocation movements are also complicated by discontinuities in the slip plane of each grain. When all these factors are considered together, the improvement in strength in the ACTIHC sample is strongly related to the grain-boundary strengthening or Hall-Petch strengthening mechanism.  

Fig. 7(a) shows the reflection (R), transmission (T) and absorption (A) coefficient curves of invar 36 (ACHF sample), which illustrate the material’s response to the incident wave, i.e., the proportion of ab­ sorption, reflection, and transmission. The S parameters (S11 and S21) of invar 36 were determined using a vector network analyzer. Reflection and transmission coefficients can be calculated from the relations $\mathtt{R}=|$ $s11|^{2}$ and $\mathrm{~T~}=~\vert\mathtt{S}21\vert^{2}$ using the reflection and absorption scattering parameters. The absorption coefficient (A) was calculated using the equation $\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{R}+\mathbf{T}=1$ [27,65]. The general mechanism in conductive materials is reflection due to the abundance of mobile charge carriers that interact with electromagnetic fields [27]. A clearly high reflection coefficient and very extremely poor transmission coefficient, with the lowest absorption coefficient, were observed throughout the X–band for invar 36. The free electrons in ferromagnetic metals are supposed to aid in surface reflection [65]. The fact that invar 36 is a soft magnetic ma­ terial with low coercivity $({\sim}24\mathrm{\A/m})$ and high electrical conductivity $(12500\mathrm{~}\mathrm{{S/cm}}$ at room temperature) and is one of the most important factors for providing good reflection and absorption parameters [63,66]. Near-zero T, relatively high A and high R values indicate that invar 36 is relatively absorptive of EM waves in the material and provides EMI shielding through significant reflection even at a $1\mathrm{mm}$ thickness.  

Fig. 7(b) shows the total $(\mathrm{SE_{T}})$ , reflection $(S\mathrm{E_{R}})$ and absorption $(\mathrm{SE_{A}})$ shielding efficiency curves of invar 36. The total shielding effectiveness represents the combination of reflection and absorption shielding effectiveness. In fact, the total shielding effectiveness is ${\bf S}{\bf E}_{\mathrm{T}}={\bf S}{\bf E}_{\mathrm{R}}+{\bf S}{\bf E}_{\mathrm{A}}$ $+\ S\mathrm{E_{M}}$ . However, $S\mathrm{E_{M}}$ usually involves multiple internal reflections considered for certain design geometries, such as porous and ultra-thin structures [27,65]. In addition, the $S\mathrm{E_{M}}$ contribution can be neglected under the conditions of $S\mathrm{E_{T}}>15$ dB, $\mathrm{{SE_{A}}>10}$ dB or plane waves con­ taining electric fields [29,65]. Since the shielding test sample is a high-density bulk alloy of sufficient thickness $\left(1\mathrm{mm}\right)$ , the $s\mathrm{E_{M}}$ is ignored in the present study. The reflection shielding efficiency $(\mathsf{S E_{R}})$ and the absorption shielding efficiency $(S\mathrm{E_{A}})$ are calculated from the reflection and transmission coefficients as given in the equations below:

The bulk invar 36 with a thickness of $1\mathrm{mm}$ showed total shielding in the range of $-55$ dB to $-65$ dB. Fig. 6(b) shows that the contribution of the reflection component to the shielding effectiveness is $-10\mathrm{dB}$ , while the contribution of the absorption component is $-50\mathrm{dB}$ . The high magnetic permeability $(\upmu_{\mathrm{max}}=6000)$ and good electrical conductivity of invar 36 are responsible for this high shielding effectiveness of ${\sim}-60$ dB [63,66]. Reflection, the primary mechanism of protection for metallic materials, is explained by the abundance of free electrons in metals so that the incident EM wave on the material is reflected between the air and the surface. With respect to the absorbing mechanism, it is well known that when an EM wave penetrates a metallic material, a micro-current is generated inside the material and this phenomenon makes an important contribution to EM wave absorption [67]. As a result, it is understood that the $1\mathrm{mm}$ thick bulk invar 36 provides sig­ nificant shielding against X–band EM waves.  

# 4. Conclusions  

The effects of Ti-Al-V triple microalloying and hot forging on the microstructure, mechanical, and physical properties of invar 36 were studied in detail. The electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding characteristics of plain invar 36 have also been investigated for the first time.  

i. All the samples have fully classical austenite $\mathit{\Pi}_{\cdot\check{Y}}$ -Fe) XRD peaks. The main diffraction peaks are γ(111), γ(200), $\upgamma(220)$ , $\gamma(311)$ and γ(222). While a slight shift to the right was observed in the XRD peaks due to the deformation-induced residual stresses, this shifting phenomenon became more pronounced with the addition of Ti-Al-V to invar 36. Considering the relative intensity of the samples, the (220) and (311) planes were oriented after the addition of the Ti-Al-V refiner.   
ii. The average grain size of the samples was reduced from $500~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ to $100\upmu\mathrm{m}$ by hot forging. A further reduction from $100\upmu\mathrm{m}$ to $40\upmu\mathrm{m}$ was achieved by Ti-Al-V triple refining.   
iii. The coefficient of thermal expansion of the samples was decreased from $1.86\times10^{-6}/{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $1.15\ \times10^{-6}/{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in the tem­ perature range of $20-100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ due to various factors such as grain and twin boundaries, that formed as a result of hot forging. These boundaries and residual stresses have had a limiting effect on the lattice vibration, which is the main reason for the low CTE. However, the increase in the CTE of the sample with added Ti-AlV was related to the distortion of the balance in the specific magnetic lattice structure and the change in interatomic distance.   
iv. The best tensile strength, hardness and total elongation were obtained for the sample with added Ti-Al-V, at $610.9\mathrm{MPa}$ , 194.3 $\mathrm{HV}_{5}$ and $40.2\%$ , respectively, which are directly related to the grain boundary strengthening mechanism.   
v. Bulk invar 36 with a thickness of $1\mathrm{mm}$ exhibited a total shielding in the range of 55 dB to $-65\mathrm{dB}$ , as indicated by the contribu­ tion of the reflection $({\sim}\mathbf{-}10~\mathrm{dB})$ and absorption (\~-50 dB) com­ ponents. Invar 36 has a very high reflection coefficient and an  

extremely poor transmission coefficient, with the lowest ab­ sorption, throughout the X–band.
